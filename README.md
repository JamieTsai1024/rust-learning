# Rust Book Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and notes from working through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (aka "The Book").

Most code here is based on the examples from the book, with some small modifications or experiments as I go.

## Structure

Each chapter or topic typically has its own folder.

## Notes

This repo is primarily for learning purposes. Feel free to reference it if you're also going through the book!
